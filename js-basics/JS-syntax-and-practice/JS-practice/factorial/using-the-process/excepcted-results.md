#Factorial code :

      numbers | results
  ✅  0       | 1
  ✅  1       | 1*1=1
  ✅  2       | 1*2=2
  ✅  3       | 1*2*3=6
  ✅  4       | 1*2*3*4 =24
    5       | 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
    6       | 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720


- if number is 0
 - factorial should be 1

-if number is not 0
  -facrtorial is the number
till 2 it will work

but for 3 it will be 3
  which is wrong
  fact 3 should be 6, which is 2*3

by this we are getting the results, and when we expand this to find the factorial till 7
we see that if we divide the factorial of the number by the number (eg: 120/) the we can multiply the answer of the pervious one to the next number to
